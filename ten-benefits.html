          Global Edge SD-WAN is not dependent on vendor proprietary hardware,
          neither in the network core or at the customer edge. Customers can use
          a growing list of x86-based hardware platforms that meet their
          business requirements and national device certification
          specifications.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Global Edge can be deployed on bare metal x86 servers, in virtual
          environments (KVM, Hyper-V, vSphere) or in container types (NSPAWN,
          Podman, Docker) using orchestration types such as Kubernetes and
          OpenShift.

          Global Edge SD-WAN enables service providers to build virtual tunnels
          that connect customer sites to the service provider network using any
          type of network connection available: fibre (FttX), wireless (LTE, 4G,
          5G), broadband over copper (DSL, HFC), L2 or L3.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Multiple connections from multiple technologies and service providers
          can be aggregated into the SD-WAN tunnel connecting sites to the
          customer network. Customers can provide their own connectivity or
          engage service providers for additional connectivity. This delivers
          provider network redundancy through the core and access as well as
          building services point redundancy.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          The SD-WAN tunnel that Global Edge provides is a fully featured
          virtual tunnel with high efficiency, automated performance management
          based on jitter, latency, packet-loss and flap detection. It provides
          bi-directional elastic Quality of Service to prioritize packets when

          Global Edge SD-WAN link aggregation technology combines the bandwidth
          of multiple circuits and delivers efficiency over 90 percent for

          Link aggregation efficiency over 90 percent is unique in a global
          market and few SD-WAN offerings reach this efficiency. High efficiency

            SD-WAN Per-packet link load balancing
          </h3>

          <p class="benefits__item-text">
            Global Edge SD-WAN design is based on per-packet load balancing.
            This approach distributes packets flowing to or from a site and
            breaks the single packet flow into multiple packet streams that are
            distributed across available circuits.
          </p>

          <p class="benefits__item-text">
            Global Edge SD-WAN configured on the CPE at each site manages packet
            distribution across the multiple circuits comprising the SD-WAN
            virtual tunnel based on user-selectable algorithms.
          </p>

          <p class="benefits__item-text">
            As the data stream from the LAN is managed at a packet-level, Global
            Edge SD-WAN can proactively and automatically change how each
            circuit in the tunnel is used, removing or adding it back into the
            virtual tunnel. This provides superior stability, efficiency and
            uptime compared to competitor solutions that use Forward Error
            Correction (“FEC”) to duplicate priority packets across multiple
            circuits, avoiding unnecessary bandwidth use and network saturation.

          <p class="benefits__item-text">
            Global Edge virtual tunnels are highly robust and adapt to changing
            network performance automatically. Bandwidth adaptation
            automatically removes circuits from the tunnel that exceed jitter,
            latency and packet loss limits and re-aggregates them once
            performance is restored. Circuit flapping is also detected and
            actively managed.

          SD-WAN Elastic, bi-directional quality of service
        </h3>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          User application performance and experience is managed through Global
          Edge’s bi-directional quality of service (QoS). By deploying Global
          Edge at the head-end in the data centre and at the customer site, both
          sides of any Internet or broadband circuit can be managed and QoS
          applied on both upstream and downstream packets. This allows real-time
          prioritisation of voice, video or packets from other applications.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Global Edge’s QoS allocation is applied to each group of circuits
          (tunnel) at a per site level in an elastic mode, meaning that
          bandwidth reservation is only applied when packets tagged as Priority
          or Real-time are present. If no such packets are present, other
          classes of traffic can use all bandwidth available in the tunnel.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Elastic QoS ensures the customer receives full access to the bandwidth
          they are paying for and is not compelled to purchase additional
          bandwidth to support fixed QoS allocations.

          SD-WAN Sub-second, same IP, session failover
        </h3>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          All circuits in Global Edge SD-WAN tunnels are active, and any that
          fail are removed from the tunnel within 300 milliseconds. Circuits can
          also be set to standby Failover status (not fully active) and added to
          the tunnel within 300ms.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Using unique IP address space for user data transport removes the
          dependency on the underlying IP addressing at a link level. This helps
          to ensure that a site’s connectivity to the Internet or the WAN is
          continuous and that all session-based applications remain active.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          From an end-user perspective, this means that voice or video calls
          will remain connected and not abruptly terminate when an individual
          circuits fail, delivering business continuity and customer
          satisfaction.

          SD-WAN security and encryption
        </h3>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          All packets transmitted across the tunnel are encapsulated in a
          UDP-based tunnel. This protocol is architected for efficiency,
          performance and security.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Tunnel traffic is protected through Global Edge’s packet-based
          distribution and industry-standard encryption algorithms. This
          technology distributes packets from data flows across the multiple
          circuits in the tunnel connecting each site to the Service Provider
          network, making data intercepts unlikely. Packets can be further
          protected through AES128, AES256 and Salsa20 encryption.

          Private WAN
        </h3>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Global Edge Private Wide Area Network gives you all the benefits of
          dedicated, leased line networks with higher flexibility, ease of
          deployment, manageability and visibility at a lower cost.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          Global Edge enables customers to cap or reduce spend on existing
          dedicated circuits and replace them with a combination of secure,
          encrypted and resilient broadband, wireless or lower-cost connections.
          Service Providers, access seekers or their customers can increase
          performance whilst saving opex.
        </p>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          In addition, Global Edge can distribute packets across multiple
          physical circuits, provided by multiple carriers or technologies to
          create the SD-WAN virtual tunnels. The likelihood of data intercepts
          is minimised as all circuits would need to be compromised and
          decrypted simultaneously.

          TCP proxy
        </h3>

        <p class="benefits__item-text">
          This built-in performance-enhancing proxy greatly increases throughput
          and is beneficial when aggregating (sometimes referred to as bonding)
          or creating a tunnel from diverse types of Internet connections, such
          as ADSL with cable, or when a connection has high jitter or varying
          bandwidth. The TCP congestion control algorithm defines the behaviour
          of proxied TCP connections. Currently, there are 14 different
          algorithms to choose from when configuring bonded connections on the
          management server.
