						WHAT IS SD-WAN: The background
					</h2>
					<ul class="prehistory__list">
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN), manages and optimizes a wide area network, and is designed to address the changing use of enterprise networks due to the growth of cloud computing and mobile devices. It is a more flexible solution than MPLS, better supporting a distributed and mobile workforce, and is more reliable and scalable than VPN-based WAN.
						</li>
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							SD-WAN is implemented as a network of SD-WAN appliances connected by encrypted tunnels. Each SD-WAN appliance is connected to a set of network services (typically MPLS and some Internet services) and monitors the availability and performance of each of these services. Traffic reaching an SD-WAN appliance is classified based on application and prioritized using a set of centrally-managed priorities before being sent out over the best available network link.
						</li>
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							SD-WAN makes it possible to replace MPLS, which is expensive and time-consuming to connect to new locations. It also allows security functionality to be distributed to the network edge, making it unnecessary to send all traffic through the enterprise data center for scanning before forwarding it to cloud services, a practice that increases latency and degrades application performance.
						</li>
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							By converging networking and security functionality, an SD-WAN can eliminate the need to deploy expensive point security products at branch locations. An SD-WAN with a large network of globally-distributed points-of-presence (PoPs) can provide high-performance, secure networking with centralized management and visibility.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="prehistory-block">
					<h3 class="prehistory__subtitle">
						The evolution
					</h3>
					<p class="prehistory__text">
						SD-WAN developed and deployed by most vendors follows proprietary models and will do so for many years to come. What has evolved and will help break down vendor lock-in solutions is the ability to support Network Functional Virtualization (NFV) on generic x86 hardware. This has led to a number of innovative approaches:
					</p>
					<ul class="prehistory__list">
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							Using x86 NFV hardware means you can avoid vendor specific hardware, operating systems and management platforms.
						</li>
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							Utilise more powerful and innovative chipsets and hardware solutions as soon as they come onto the market allows for increased performance and scalability.
						</li>
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							Choose hardware from generic providers or select a vendor for x86 hardware (such as Juniper NFX or Cisco ENCS).
						</li>
						<li class="prehistory__item">
							The rise of Open SD-WAN initiatives will drive a rise in the number of vendors providing solutions at the CPE than you may otherwise have used in the past.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="prehistory-block">
					<h3 class="prehistory__subtitle">
						Not all are equal
					</h3>
					<p class="prehistory__text">
						SD-WAN by most vendors differs greatly and not all vendors are equal. Many vendors fail to deliver beyond Active/Active paths to make the transition to bonded services.  Bonding allows elevated performance while still maintaining critical QOS criteria.
